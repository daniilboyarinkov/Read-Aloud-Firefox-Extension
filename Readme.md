# BDwRA - Firefox Extension that reads aloud the selected text.

This is my first Firefox extension just for touching the ground of how on Earth do extensions work.

# What does that extension?

The Extension of mine can read aloud selected text on any website and even in inputs.

---

# What to do?

Just select some text and press popup button or action in context menu and you will hear fascinating voice of standart Web speaker.
